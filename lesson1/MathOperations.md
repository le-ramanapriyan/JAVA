# Math Operations

Math operations involve performing calculations using numbers. These operations include:
- Addition (`+`)
- Subtraction (`-`)
- Multiplication (`*`)
- Division (`/`)
- Modulus (`%`) – finding the remainder

They are fundamental building blocks for solving numerical problems and manipulating data in programming.

## Example (Java)

```java
public class MathOperationsExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 10;
        int b = 3;

        System.out.println("Addition: " + (a + b));
        System.out.println("Subtraction: " + (a - b));
        System.out.println("Multiplication: " + (a * b));
        System.out.println("Division: " + (a / b));
        System.out.println("Modulus: " + (a % b));
    }
}
```

**Output:**
```
Addition: 13
Subtraction: 7
Multiplication: 30
Division: 3
Modulus: 1
```
